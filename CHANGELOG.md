## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Crate skeleton: package metadata, MSRV 1.85 and the `cli` feature layout.
- `Bulb` and `Bulb::request()`: the reliable request/response path, with paced
  datagrams, retries and reply matching.
- `Request` / `Response` / `DeviceError`: the protocol envelope, parsed so that
  unknown fields are ignored.
- `Error`, a typed error for each way an exchange can fail, and `RetryPolicy`,
  which configures how hard `request()` tries.
